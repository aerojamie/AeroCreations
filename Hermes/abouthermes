Hermes

Hermes is a Python script designed to test the strength of passwords by brute-forcing them character by character. It also sends the provided password to a specified Discord webhook for further analysis.

Usage

To use Hermes, simply execute the script and follow the prompts. Enter the password you want to test when prompted, and Hermes will start guessing the password character by character.

Important Notes

	•	Use Hermes responsibly and only on passwords that you own or have explicit permission to test.
	•	Be aware that brute-forcing passwords is a time-consuming process and may not always be successful.
	•	Ensure that you have permission to send data to the specified Discord webhook.
